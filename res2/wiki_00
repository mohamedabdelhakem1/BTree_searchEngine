Archer typeface
Archer is a slab serif typeface designed in 2001 by Tobias FrereJones and Jonathan Hoefler for use in Martha Stewart Living magazine It was later released by Hoefler  FrereJones for commercial licensing

The typeface is a geometric slab serif one with a geometric design similar to sansserif fonts It takes inspiration from midtwentieth century designs such as Rockwell

The face is unique for combining the geometric structure of twentiethcentury European slabserifs but imbuing the face with a domestic less strident tone of voice Balls were added to the upper terminals on letters such as C and G to increase its charm Italics are true italic designs with flourishes influenced by calligraphy an unusual feature for geometric slab serif designs As with many Hoefler  FrereJones designs it was released in a wide range of weights from hairline to bold reflecting its design goal as a typeface for complex magazines

The typeface has been used for among other things branding for Wells Fargo and is a main font for the San Francisco Chronicle and Wes Andersons film The Grand Budapest Hotel It is also the current font used for titles and body text by the Design Observer website
