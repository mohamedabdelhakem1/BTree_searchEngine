Since 1996s Revenge album the Flying Luttenbachers musical output has been underlined by a gradually unravelling storyline concerning the selfobliteration of the planet Earth and the resulting aftermath The 2006 album Cataclysm concerns an interstellar battle between two monolithic entities The Void a dark silent spectre detailed on 2004s album of the same name and The Iridescent Behemoth a massive planetoid being whose tale was told on 2003s complex Systems Emerge From Complete Disorder album The music energetically utilizes deliberate harmonic dissonance and the material operates on a principle of intelligent transformation of concise amounts of interrelated themes
